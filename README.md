# sign-language-evaluator
A python solution empowered with OpenPose to evaluate hand sign language correctness.

### Intuition
In daily life, there will be people around us who can't talk to each other and they need to use sign language to communicate with each other. As the communication language of deaf-mutes, sign language plays a very important role for them. Because it is a kind of gestural symbol, if some gestures are wrong during the learning process of sign language, people may not be able to express their ideas correctly. However, in the current sign language teaching, there is no sign language correction link, and people normally compare themselves with video and imitate themselves, so when learning sign language, people cannot well confirm whether their sign language learning is correct. So, this project aims to allow people to correct their sign language and learn sign language better to communicate with others. In the project, we used python as a whole for programming, openpose, an open-source tool, for people's sign language recognition, trained the database through machine learning, and compared it with standard sign language, so as to check the correction.
